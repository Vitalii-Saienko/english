My professional background primarily lies in the field of accounting, specifically in the food and beverages industry. I have a strong track record of working in a fast-paced environment, particularly in the HoReCa sector. I've been involved in various aspects of accounting, including management accounting, where I handled financial analysis, budgeting, and forecasting.

Despite my success in accounting, I found myself drawn to the world of information technology. To make this career transition, I enrolled in the Tel-Ran IT School for Java Backend Development. The program provided me with a solid foundation in Java programming and the necessary skills to develop back-end solutions.

During my time at the IT school, I worked on a variety of projects that allowed me to hone my coding abilities and collaborate effectively with my peers. These experiences have taught me the value of problem-solving, attention to detail, and continuous learning.

I believe that my background in accounting, coupled with my IT education, has equipped me with a unique perspective. I bring strong analytical skills, a keen eye for detail, and the ability to work well within a team to achieve project goals. I am motivated by challenges and always strive to deliver high-quality work.

In my transition from accounting to IT, I am eager to apply my existing skills while expanding my technical expertise as a junior Java developer. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the growth and success of your organization, leveraging my passion for technology and my commitment to professional development.
